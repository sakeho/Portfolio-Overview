# Portfolio Overview

Welcome to my portfolio of **cybersecurity**, **systems administration**, and **emerging technology** projects. This repository serves as a central hub that links to separate, dedicated labs where I showcase my hands-on work in areas such as penetration testing, virtual network security, digital forensics, and automation.

## About Me

I am a cybersecurity and systems administration professional, as well as an emerging technology researcher. I focus on bridging theoretical frameworks with real-world applications by deploying diverse tools and techniques. My goal is to continually expand my skill set while contributing to the broader cybersecurity community.

## Portfolio Structure

- [**Cybersecurity Labs**](https://github.com/your-username/cybersecurity-labs)  
  Hands-on projects covering secure virtual networks, penetration testing, and digital forensics.

- [**Systems Administration Labs**](https://github.com/your-username/systems-administration-labs)  
  Scripts and tools for user audits, service monitoring, and backup automation.

- [**Computing Technology Labs**](https://github.com/your-username/computing-technology-labs)  
  General-purpose utilities, CLI frameworks, and emerging tech experiments.

Each of these repositories is structured as a modular lab. Within them, you will find dedicated projects (added as submodules) that dive into specific areas, such as:

### Example Breakdown in Cybersecurity Labs

- **Virtual Network Security Lab**  
  A dedicated environment for setting up and testing virtual networks with firewalls, IDS, and servers.

- **Penetration Testing Toolkit**  
  A collection of scripts and tools for automated vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.

- **Digital Forensics Workflows**  
  Projects focusing on log analysis, incident response, and file integrity monitoring.

I use a modular approach with Git submodules where each lab remains an independent repository, allowing me to manage and evolve them separately while keeping everything interconnected.
